#  Asset Modelling Guidelines

This document explains how each model in our project should be structured.  
All assets are handcrafted by our modeller following these guidelines so that our program can interpret them consistently.

---

## 1. Model Scale & Proportion
- All models **must be created in proportion** to each other.  
- You can import multiple models into Blender/Maya to verify relative scaling.  
- This ensures:
  - Consistent sizing across all assets.
  - We can apply a **global base scale** for uniformity.

---

## 2. Material Naming Convention
Each model’s materials must follow strict naming rules so the program can correctly group and recolor them.

- Allowed material names:
  - `primary`
  - `secondary`
  - `tertiary`

   Note: blender and maya automatically adds in numbers between material names to avoid duplication;
   so e.g. you will get 'primary', and 'primary.001' etc etc; this is fine as our model handles it;
   so there is no need to do anything extra; as long as the name contains primary, secondary, tertiary;
   it's fine.

- Rules:
  - All materials with the **same name must share the same base colour**.
  - Only `primary`, `secondary`, and `tertiary` are user-changeable/ program changeable colours.
  - Any other material name (or unnamed material):
    - **Will not be recolourable** in the program.
    - Should be used for parts of the model that must stay consistent (e.g. metal parts, wood textures).

## 3. Light-Emitting Models
Some models can emit light (lamps, TVs, candles, etc).  
These require additional rules:

### 3.1 Bulb Meshes
- Any model that emits light must contain **one or more meshes named `bulb`**.
- Place `bulb` meshes where the physical light source would be:
  - Inside a lamp (the bulb itself).
  - At the top of a candle wick.
  - Inside a TV screen.

- Notes:
  - If the **bulb material should be recolourable**, give it a `primary` / `secondary` / `tertiary` name.  
  - If not, any name will suffice.

### 3.2 Light-Responsive Meshes
Some meshes should visually change when the model’s light turns on/off.  
Use these mesh naming conventions:

- `fabric_light` → Mesh should **glow & fade** like light bleeding through fabric (e.g. lamp shade).  
- `screen_light` → Mesh should **emit light strongly**, without transparency/colour change (e.g. TV screen).  
- unnamed → Mesh will not change with light.

---

## 4. Material Types & Properties
- The specific material type (Phong, Blinn, etc.) **does not matter**.  
- Our program automatically:
  - Converts all materials into a matte, opaque, non-reflective style.
- This may change in the future if we add more advanced rendering.

---

##  Summary:
- Keep models **to scale** with each other.  
- Use **only `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`** for user-changeable colours.  
- Use **`bulb` meshes** for light sources.  
- Use **`fabric_light`** or **`screen_light`** for special light-responsive meshes.  
- Leave other materials unnamed if they shouldn’t be affected by the program.
